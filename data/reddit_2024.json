I have 2 options; take Lumo from King‚Äôs Cross and have a connection onto a ScotRail Inter7City train to Inverness, or take LNER nonstop from King‚Äòs Cross. \n\nAs well as the choice of operators, should I go in First Class if I take LNER? From what I know you get some free meals and a more comfortable seat. Although to be honest I wouldn‚Äôt call the seat ‚ÄúFirst Class‚Äù, perhaps they could‚Äôve installed some comfortable recliners like the First Classes NSW TrainLink, V/Line, KTX and TGVs. \n\nSo, should I take Lumo and ScotRail or LNER to Scotland if this trip becomes reality?"

Previous owner put it on so I have no idea which coating brand it is, but it's lasted this long so I know it must be a true ceramic coating. I'm enjoying it while it lasts because I definitely won't be getting another pro coating, it'll just get stripped every 2-3 years when I polish\n\nWhat's your favorite ceramic topper?\n\n I've liked griot's 3 in 1 ceramic spray, but it doesn't bead quite as well as the true ceramic layer, and it seems to attract dust. Smells great, lasts long and easy to apply, no streaking issues either. Just looking for others to try"

That way I would have more abilities to actually use on my bar. \n\nBut as I have started to dive into the scribing, I've realized there are alot of limitations both focus script wise (specifically damage types  is what bothers me), and affix script wise with buffs. \n\nHaving major brutality and sorcery for example on only 2 skills out of the 11 kills the diversity hard for me. Same thing with the force and savagery/prophecy buffs as well. \n\nI haven't really dived into the focus scripts with this post but they basically share the same problems at least damage type wise. \n\nI would like to hear people's opinions on the subject and why the current system is like this? The only things I can possibly think of is for balance or a lack of time to fully integrate the options on every skill. Either way it has really narrowed the potential to where I have basically disregarded the system."

Ever since getting into privacy, I've done everything I can to make my Windows system as private as possible. Like encrypting my disk, using Portmaster, using O&O shut up, and many more, and I've gotten to a point where I feel good about my system.\n\nSo anyways...\n\nI've wanted to improve my OS privacy further for a while but I feel that switching to Linux is quite a big jump. I am very familiar with the Windows system and I only have a basic understanding of Linux Ubuntu. For regular use Linux is great, I already use it on my school laptop for very rudimentary tasks and it works perfectly, however, for gaming (which is what I predominantly use my Windows PC for) and other complex tasks, I'm worried that I might be lacking on Linux, and that I probably don't have the knowledge to configure the necessary software (Proton, Bottles/Wine) to work, or perform the complex tasks that are just so much easier on Windows.\n\nFurthermore, completely shifting OS is incredibly tedious, and could put my data in jeopardy. I know I can always make a backup of my Windows system but there is always a risk that I could lose important data. Additionally, transferring important files would take a long time (I have a lot of files that I can't afford to lose), and the files may not even function/be compatible with the Linux versions of the applications I used on Windows.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me on what I should do, or anything that could help my situation. **I was also curious if anyone knew anything about alternative Windows ISOs, like Tiny11 or AtlasOS** (I know they're such a joke but if any of them have any merit).\n\nI'd be very appreciative of any help you could give me.\n\nI am also very sorry for the long ass yap sesh you just had to read :("

While one seeks to preserve the guitar at the expense of ever letting it be used for what it is meant, the other seeks to destroy something beautiful to con others into the belief that they are cultured and worldly. I present to you the idea that both of these twisted ideologies, despite the outward differences, are actually two separate cloaks shrouding the same beast. The vanity and fetishism, the obsession with having what others don't, makes it clear that they are not different at their core, but instead simply different facets of the same perversion.

Basic things like viewing your bill, changing your address or contact information are nearly impossible. Understanding why you are paying hundreds of dollars in additional fees is also challenging.\n\nWhen I tried to port my number to a higher value service provider (Koodo, $29/month for 40GB, vs. $60/month for 7GB) I was told by Koodo that Bell Corporate has a transfer blocking \"feature\" on the account that I need to call them to remove this. \n\nCan't call them except Monday-Friday 9-5. \n\nOnce I reach them I'm told I can't make changes because I'm not the primary contact on the account (it was set up through my wife's employer initially). \n\nI use her credentials to modify the primary account holder details so that I can make the request.\n\nI am glibly (gleefully?) told I will need to pay for two more months because Bell Corporate is not covered under the regulations of the CRTC, which gives consumers the right to cancel their plan and change their service provider.\n\nThen I am told I cannot make changes to the account, that they need to be made through a 3rd party company which handles the communication contracts of my wife's former employer. \n\nI am pretty sure the customer service person could have found a solution for me and made the changes and waived any additional fees, but back to my original point -- individuals are not their customer.

Our event strives to act as an alternative circuit for VGC Players to the New TPCI circuit that caters to the following: \n\n1. **Low Registration Fees** - Regional Level Events can run upwards of $70 just to register for the event. Our events are $10 for our ‚ÄúRegional‚Äù level events, and $15 for our International (Price/currency used is adjusted depending on host region). **EVERY EVENT HAS A PRIZE POOL BASED OFF OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE EVENT!**\n\n2. **No Travel Costs/Compete from the comfort of your own home!** - Travel fees are likely what will incur players the largest amount of expenses during a Worlds Qualifying run. You may even see players unable to attend the World Championship itself due to the cost of travel. \n\n3. **Qualify based off Minimum Point Bar** - **ALL** players who hit or exceed 40 Grassroot Points will qualify for our invitational event, the Grand Grassoots Cup!\n\n4. **Best Finish Limits** - Only the 4 best finishes from our ‚ÄúRegional‚Äù events and 1 from our ‚Äúinternational‚Äù events count towards your qualification. *This hopefully eliminates the issue of availability, as those who may have the ability to attend multiple international events in the official TPCI circuit have a significant advantage compared to their peers who cannot.*\n\n5. **Multiple Event Times** - Due to the collaborative nature of this event, you will have 3 separate event hosts, from 3 separate regions which you may compete within! **Points transfer between all the regions so feel free to play in the events that are more friendly to your timezone!**\n\n6. Up-to-date rulesets : We will always be using the most up-to-date vgc format/rules that are used in the official circuit! \n\n7. **Highest Level of professionalism** - Just because this is a grassroots hosted event doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt serious about the structure, operations, and professionalism of the event. We have created an Inclusion Policy & Standards of Conduct Modeled after TPCI‚Äôs own policies on these matters. Additionally, we have created a Guide/FAQ and a Tournament Rulebook to help you as players understand how the circuit works!\n\nGrand Grassroots Circuit Will also be partnering with @ryanpbherbet from Devoncorp to bring you another Official Webpage for our event!\n\nWebsite link: /grand-grassroots-circuit\n\nAll tournament info will posted below in the tournament announcement section and a seperate section for Grand Grassroots circuit will appear below üôÇ Any questions shoot me a message!"

Guys showed up and delivered the appliances, but upon looking at the electrical situation, told me they could not install the cooktop. Told me I'd have to either buy a gas cooktop or hire an electrician to complete the proper wiring. Also told me they couldn't install the wall oven, since in doing so, the electrician would have to move it, \"voiding the warranty\". Told me to call them back when the wiring was done and they'd do the install.\n\nI was left with an unboxed oven, and the unopened cooktop. No installation performed, just delivery. On a Friday afternoon.\n\nI got lucky, found a local electrician who came over almost immediately, and not only hooked things up vis-a-vis wiring, but went ahead and installed everything for a very nominal fee.\n\nSo, I figure since Best Buy contractor did not install anything, Best Buy should refund the several hundred $$$ of installation fees, or most of it. Getting ready to call them, but wondering what kind of run-around I'll get. Thoughts? Your experience in similar situation?"

I understand that under normal circumstances the turns ratio should be 1:1, owing to the impedance transform of 1:N\\^2. But...\n\nWhat determines the ACTUAL number of turns? For instance, how should I decide whether to use 4T to 4T, 11T to 11T, or 20T to 20T etc. What determines this, how to measure what is appropriate, etc?\n\nAs I read on:\n\n [/RFI-Ham.pdf](/RFI-Ham.pdf)\n\nI read that \"More impedance is better\"... but assuming I am feeding the balun primary from 50ohm coax, isn't that going to be an issue? Shouldn't I have to feed 50ohm coax into a primary coil that has am impedance of (at least close to) 50ohm? Or are some ohms/impedances more equal than others?\n\nMany thanks beforehand for anyone who can explain this to me. I'd really appreciate it."

My first playthroughs of SoS and DmD back in the day made me feel like I was really advancing with Dante and Nero, but I barely scraped through V's levels and never felt like I really knew how I did it. And apparently I'm in the minority on this, because the community at large has been calling him the easiest character in DMC5 since launch, so can anybody tell me what I'm missing?\n\nMy main issue is how unresponsive his demons can feel compared to normal attacks, especially since you have to call them back to use your evasive moves. On higher difficulties, this leads to me playing keep away in every fight because when I try to get V out of danger, the more aggressive enemies have already caught up before I can get Griffon and/or Shadow out to engage them again, so eventually I have to just stand there and trade damage in order to get any attacks off. That combined with how hard it can be to get shadow to target who you want him to just makes me feel like I'm never in control with V like the other characters."

        "text": "Hi,\n\nIn one of the applications we are getting transactions in messages/events format and also in files and then they are getting parsed and stored into the relational database. The number of attributes/columns each transaction has is \\~900+. Logically they are part of one single transaction and should be stored in one table as one single row. There will be \\~500million such transactions each day coming into the system. And there will be approx \\~10K peak write TPS and 5K read TPS in target state. This system has a postgres database as a \"source of truth\" or OLTP store. And then data moves to snowflakes for the olap store.  \n  \nInitially when the system was designed the number of attributes per transaction was <100 but slowly the business wants to keep/persist other attributes too in the current system and the number of columns keep growing.  \n  \nHowever, as worked with some database systems , we get few suggestions from DBA's to not have many columns in a single table. For example in oracle they say not to go beyond \\~255 columns as then row chaining and row migration type of things are going to hunt us. Also we are afraid concurrent DMLS on the table may cause this as a contention point. So I wanted to understand , in such a situation what would be the best design approach we should use irrespective of databases? Or say, what is the maximum number of columns per table we should restrict? Should we break the single transaction into multiple tables like one main table and other addenda tables with the same primary key to join and fetch the results wherever necessary?"

Almost all of its customers are still left in the dark and there has been a class action lawsuit that has been filed. But I‚Äôm here to talk about another possible side to this breach many may not know about yet. Patelco has claimed that ‚Äúyour money is safe‚Äù to its customers and that the hackers didn‚Äôt obtain sensitive payment information.\n\nPatelco was breached on June 29th, and I received fraudulent charges in my checking account with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT credit union on July 5th. There were a couple of debit card ‚Äútest charges‚Äù for $5 each in Texas with a ‚ÄúGSM, LLC‚Äù‚Ä¶then the card was sold in the black market and racked up 8 other charges‚Äîon the same day‚Äî as ‚ÄúUBER‚Äù but based in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. That led to several other foreign transaction fees automatically tacked on to my account. While my credit union is working to reverse the charges, I wondered‚Ä¶.how was it possible for my debit card to be hacked since I never use them to make transactions? They‚Äôre always sitting in a locked drawer in my desk, while I always charge everything to a credit card then pay them off with a bank transfer at the end of the month. \n\nThen remembered I patronized a local Patelco back in December of 2023 to make a deposit into the ATM. Not remembering which debit card/account I used, I scoured through previous statements and there it was in plain sight, it was the account from the same credit union that I got hacked from.\n\nSo if any of you patronized Patelco with shared branching as part of another credit union, but somehow still got hacked or had fraudulent charges made on your debit card recently‚Ä¶don‚Äôt buy that whole ‚Äúyour money is safe‚Äù schpeel from Patelco and take preventative measures now. Lock your debit cards you believe were used in Patelco ATMs, and get them reissued. I have a hunch that the hackers from the Patelco cyberattack somehow got ahold of debit card information previously used in Patelco ATMs. Now the question is, what do I do, or who do I contact, higher up, to get them to investigate this possible side to the breach?"

Still trying choose a path where I could still leverage the MSI Cubi otherwise might just sell it?\n\nOn ideas to keep the Cubi: thought about moving Cubi to RAID and keep important data there - I would just need an extra disk I believe.\n\nThen I could use the new DELL DIY for all my services using k8s experiments + expanded data storage that could be disposable, I guess raid 0 there?\n\nWhat you guys think? I am bit lost at this stage and would really appreciate your opinions/feedback/experiences when you stumbled upon the same question/problem.\n\nThank you!"

George felt disrespected in some capacity by LA, LA is not really a contender, Philly seems to be a contender particularly in the weaker Eastern Conference compared to the West, etc. Yet less attention for some reason has been given around the league to the role of the Pennsylvania State legislature, and particularly SB740. \n\nWe‚Äôre all familiar with State Senator Mike Regan‚Äôs work on the Local Government subcommittee as its vice-chair and this piece of legislation is just one of his many efforts. You probably already know this but for those unaware SB740 amended the Second Class Township Code of 1933 that provides for certain rules and regulations regarding municipalities, so that county auditors and accountants would received further compensation for their work. County auditors play a bigger role in free agent decision-making than financially illiterate people online seem to think, because they help make sure counties are reporting accurate financial information so that funds going towards things players care about like roads and other infrastructure are effectively managed. Los Angeles has notoriously inefficient spending and municipal management and California seems to be trailing behind Pennsylvania on matters of improving local municipalities. \n\nBut maybe you don‚Äôt think this was a primary factor in George‚Äôs decision but a secondary or tertiary one.

One of my non ICU attendings did say that its fun because it's a young man's game. But once you have kids/wife and start to get older, people just do full time OR.\n\n  \nThe reason why I like ICU is because it's some time away from the OR but still getting to practice anesthesia. I like the team rounding aspect and understanding the deep intense physiology of ICU patients. \n\n  \nThe big question is it worth the opportunity cost of 1 year attending salary? For those who do ICU, do u end up making less than full time OR? Are you limited to academic settings? or is it possible to do academic ICU but PP anesthesia? Is it truly a young man's game and not for those who want a chiller lifestyle?"

His explosiveness is Tyreek esque, not his top speed, but his acceleration, his YAC is CeeDee Lamb with a bit more juice, his movement ability is Antonio Brown, his ball skills are Devonta Smith.\nHe is simply unbelievable and has the highest ceiling of any player in this past draft.\nGiants fans, be sure to appreciate him in these years to come."

The files are stored in a folder on my computer, no onedrive no upload center, they are ON MY COMPUTER!!!! And yet they won't play unless I go back to my homeroom wifi.

I have looked through google, but a lot of the recommendations to fix this issue are for window computers, or other brands. \n\nI have uninstalled Microsoft and reinstalled it. This has not fixed it. I've restarted my computer multiple times, this fixes it temporarily but the issue comes back again after using word for a few minutes. Both word, and my Mac is up to date. \n\nI am not too digitally savvy so don't know where to look on my computer, or what to look for that can explain this. \n\nI have a lot of uni work to do and just need word to work properly.

For the past decade, I have used Google Voice on this phone with my personal line, but I'm getting frustrated by the lack of RCS support in GV now that iPhones support RCS.\n\nI'm considering getting a true second line for my personal use on an eSIM and adding it to my work phone in a DSDS setup so I can have RCS for my personal texting (Android).\n\nI assume I won't need a data plan at all since I have my primary work line for that. (My work only monitors my separate work apps container, so I'm not concerned using the phone for other personal use outside the container using the work line data).\n\nThe one caveat I'm aware of, is that VZ has limitations on supporting VoWiFi for certain MVNOs, and I need WiFi calling for my personal line since I have bad service at home (Verizon is the worst, but even TMO and ATT hasn't been reliable in my home for friends and family).\n\nAny recommendations greatly appreciated taking into account (1) cost and (2) WiFi calling support for Verizon Android device.

Thanks to them, I have in turn now have this fear to drive on freeways and never go out. But I‚Äôm not the one the has been in 2 car accidents this year alone. \n\nThe topic of moving out has been difficult. Really, anytime I say I want to do something, they‚Äôll say ‚Äúyou go ahead and do what you want‚Äù and wave their arms around dismissing me. If you could only hear the tone of their voices. They say out loud that I can do whatever, but their tone says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, like it‚Äôs going to happen‚Äù I pry further in why they don‚Äôt want me to move out, because I know their true feelings. They start to go off in saying ‚Äúwhy would you want to move out? you have everything you need here at home‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy do you want to move out? I only moved out when I was 22 because I needed to. There was no space for me at your grandparents house when I grew up there‚Äù I want to move out and have experiences in life skills that I did not gain from college. I never attended college due to not doing well academically, but still went to community college to see what could come up. I had only enough to pay for 9 months before quitting. Parents never saved money for college, they‚Äôre not financially smart. Sure they get their bills paid, but with the recent car accidents and nearly weekly ‚Äúdate nights‚Äù at casinos, it frustrates me that I can no longer attend college if I wanted. Early on, when trying to fill out the FASFA, I needed their information as I filled out the forms, but they were more concerned with entertaining my sister‚Äôs 2 year old as I asking them questions regarding the form. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt allowed to have a job until I was in my early 20s. My friend helped me get a job at a local place and it was a fun part time job. Everyday coming home from work, I get told ‚Äúwhy do you want to work there and deal with all those customers?‚Äù What they don‚Äôt know is that I enjoyed talking to them more than I did with my own parents. It was the only time I could have social interactions. Not because I wasn‚Äôt allowed friends, I had let go all but one of my friends due to mental health and trust issues. So, being at a job where I got to talk with people made me feel happy, even if it was small talk, I genuinely enjoyed it. \n\nThis are some instances where I can think of here my parents don‚Äôt agree with what I do or what I think, and leading me to think that I need to depend on them."

Picked a 6pm showing and expected children (it's a Disney Pixar film), but I did not expect to have toddlers screaming and talking the whole way through the film. \n\nI just don't get it? Some 5/6/7 year old kids cannot sit through a 90min film, but toddlers aged 2/3 is a whole other level of absolutely not!!! \n\nThe family consisted of 3 women in their 30s, one had 3 year old twin boys, the other 2 had infants under 1. The infants cried constantly so their parents did eventually leave around 45 minutes in with them after a lady in the row in front asked if they could consider calming the babies a little and another group moved rows to move away. But the mum with the toddlers was something else. The toddlers were running up and down the aisle, climbing over the chairs, throwing items and shaking very loud maracca style toys. They also were shouting the whole way through the film, and the mum was not shushing them, instead just replied to them quite loudly like she was having a conversation with them. You could tell it really annoyed the people sat in front of them. \n\nAlthough I was sat further away, it totally ruined the film because I couldn't concentrate with the distraction of it all. \n\nMy plea to any parents out there. Children under 4 DO NOT belong in the cinema. They will not sit still and be quiet for the film, and will thus disrupt everyone else. Cinema goers should not have to put up with unruly toddlers and it's the parents who are at fault because they didn't respect that people want to watch a film without their children being loud. It's not their living room and you have to think of others, plus kids that young couldn't care less about the film and would have been better watching it at home later on down the line so they could chatter all the way through without annoying others. \n\nJust to add, I had a lovely family sat behind us with a 6 and 8 year old. Both sat so well through the whole film and loved it. \n\nRant over, but this has happened so many times now that I do wonder whether parents genuinely have lost their common sense?"

I basically never use a fighting-type on my team, unless it is a Mienfoo/Mienshao, just because I really like them specifically for some reason I can't identify.\n\n  \nMy favorite type is Normal. I just like this idea of there being basic animals that can hold their own and even win as just a bird, or just a bull/cow, or just a dog, or just a rodent, or whatever, in a world where other animals have evolved psychic powers or control over the very elements comprising the world themselves. Plus, they are great for playthrough teams since the vast majority of them have amazing move-sets, giving you easier access to type coverage you either don't otherwise have easy access to or don't want to use. Plus, only being weak to one thing and only resisted by types that are weak to things you'll always have with you in a playthrough means they are useful in almost every battle, unlike Pok√©mon of other types that you might need to rotate out against certain gyms."

I have a better understanding after doing some research and watch YouTube videos, but here‚Äôs my desperate confusion in a series of questions:\n\nIf a magnetic field is needed to induce electricity and electricity is needed to have a magnetic field, which one comes first? The earth‚Äôs outer core is liquid molten metal and has convection currents which generate electricity with the help of an already established magnetic field? Or is it established mini magnetic fields within the core due to the convection currents or would that be the same thing? If there‚Äôs an electrical current there‚Äôs always a magnetic field. How does a magnetic field already exist to create an electrical current and needs an electrical current to exist I‚Äôm not even sure I know what I‚Äôm confused about here someone help! Is it like nuclear fusion in that it ‚Äúhelps itself‚Äù using its own process? Also can someone help me apply this to electronics and electrical systems?"

I‚Äôm in my early 20s from Aus and travelling with my mother who grew up here in Lima but since we‚Äôre planning on staying for a whole month I was wondering if I would be safe to explore some parts of the city on my own. My mum has things to do over there and I decided to just tag along so I hope I can still have some autonomy while she‚Äôs busy. I‚Äôm aware of the touristy areas to stay in but even then I‚Äôd just like some reassurance that I would be safe to just stroll around midday by myself (and where If possible) or visit some of the markets I‚Äôve been hearing about. \nFor reference i grew up in a bubble and I always feel safe on my own no matter where I am and love taking long walks while listening to music. My Independence means a lot but again so does my safety and I don‚Äôt want to have a false sense of security. I heard that I shouldn‚Äôt keep my phone out at all nor have any AirPods in (not even one?). Does this mean that using maps is a no go? Especially because as my mum points out I‚Äôll easily be seen as a ‚Äògringa‚Äô and for someone who hates attention I‚Äôm already a little nervous. Should I dress down as well and not bring any big or I guess flashy purses so as to not stand out even more? And how about taxis‚Ä¶are they safe or should I only use Uber ? \nI also can speak Spanish, though I sometimes forget words so it‚Äôs more like Spanglish lol but enough to get by. \nAnyways, any tips will be greatly appreciated and if anyone has any recommendations of activities I can do as a solo gal while in the city to keep my occupied I will be overjoyed!!

        "text": "Buenas tardes gente del Reddit, estamos en empoca de fin de clases, ya hay gente graduada de bachiller por ahi buscando universidades o instituos en los que inscribirse, y este post va dirigido o bien a gente que este buscando opiniones sobre institutos, recien graduados o familiares de recien graduados, para hablarles desde mi experiencia y que piensen antes de inscribirse en el IUTA.\n\nPara dar contexto, estudio en el IUTA la carrera de Inform√°tica, no dire sede ni semestre por obvias razones, pero lo que si dire es que desde el principio, una vez ya inscrito, el primer dia de clases, empezaron las amenazas, que si la matricula era poca, si eramos pocos estudiantes, nos podrian mandar a otra sede o en su defecto a clases virtuales (esto a pesar de que al momento de inscribirte tu te inscribes en la sede y modalidad que tu prefieres, asi como dicen sus tantos anuncios en diferentes redes sociales, radios, panfletos, etc) entonces nos dijeron que debiamos convencer a nuestros compa√±eros para que no dejen la carrera (como si nosotros tubieramos poder sobre eso, cada quien tiene diferentes situaciones de vida que uno no puede controlar).\n\nEn fin, hace un tiempo nos paso que la matricula fue baja, ya quedabamos muy pocos cursando la carrera entonces el dia de inicio de clases nos encontramos con la sorpresa de que habiamos sido cambiados de sede, asi nanda mas, de forma completamente arbitraria y sin siquiera informarnos. Si uno se inscribe en una sede se supone que es porque le queda cerca, o simplemente le gusta mas, no importa, el caso es que se esta pagando por un servicio especifico y ellos te obligan a recibir otro por conveniencia de ellos. Ahora bien, nosotros introducimos una exposici√≥n de motivos (algo que si te vas a inscribir en el IUTA mejor que ya tengas preparado desde dia uno, ya que la necesitaras mas de una vez), luego de introducirla nos dieron la respuesta de que nos dejarian en la sede... Pero con la mitad de la matricula en linea (todo esto paso en el transcurso de una semana, lo cual nos retraso una semana de clases y nos peso gravemente en la entrega de actividades).\n\n\n\n\nLes contare resumidamente lo que es cursar una materia online en el IUTA:\n\nUsan moodle, una plataforma que muchos recordaran con odio del tiempo de la pandemia. Lo que ellos hacen es copiar informaci√≥n gratuita de google y pegarla en moodle, ademas a√±aden videos de youtube como \"refuerzo\" del \"conocimiento\" muchas veces las clases no tienen nada que ver con las actividades, por ejemplo en programaci√≥n el primer bloque nos hablaba sobre el interprete y tipos de variables, nada mas, pero la primera prueba eran operaciones con listas, ciclos condicionales, y otras cosas que no fueron explicadas en ningun momento en el bloque, se tubo que buscar casi todo por internet... Les quiero recordar esto, esta gente cobra 100$ al mes, mas 95$ de inscripci√≥n, para meterte en una p√°gina incipida, llena de informaci√≥n escupida al azar, informaci√≥n que  no revisan, que no es hecha por ellos, informacion que esta gratis en internet, sin proporcionarte ayuda real ya que los \"tutores\" responden cuando se les da la gana y tampoco son de gran ayuda. Ademas de esto te mandan un monton de actividades y en nuestro caso nos dieron 3 semanas para hacerlas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhora les hablare sobre el trato al estudiante:\n\nPrimeramente las cuotas, la universidad toma decisiones muy arbitrarias como ya les dije en la parte anterior, en el caso de nosotros cuando nos quejamos por las clases online nos dijeron que lo que sucedia era que \"la situaci√≥n economica del pais\" asies, b√°sicamente nos dijeron que la situaci√≥n economica del pais les afectaba, y me imagino que solo a ellos, porque a nosotros como estudiantes nos aumentan la cuota mensual todos los semestres, y de paso en este la subieron a 95 y luego a medio semestre agregaron 5$+, la gente se quejo ya que la universidad se encuentra en pesimas condiciones, muchos aires funcionan a medias, seguramente no aguanten al a√±o que viene, el laboratorio de informatica bue' ni les hablo, las maquinas estan llenas de virus, son nuy lentas (ha pesar de que hay varias con buenas especificaciones, pero al no haber tecnico de laboratorio estas se han llenado de virus por gente que descarga cosas o simplemente porque muchos profesores no saben como tratarlas) las maquinas no estan nisiquiera adaptadas para dar clases, hace poco actualizaron la matricula de informatica y empezaron clases sin siquiera tener las maquinas con los programas necesarios instalados para poder dar clases de la nueva matricula, o por ejemplo, en la materia de base de datos dan SQL, pero el mismo no esta instalado en ninguna maquina, en su lugar te explican Access!! Ademas de que hace meses que nos prometieron que estaban habilitando un nuevo laboratorio pero al parecer las \"maquinas\" no han llegado... Llevan 3 meses desde que nos dijeron eso.\n\nOtra cosa, como les dije antes uno debe ser comprensibos con ellos pq la situaci√≥n econ√≥mica del pais, pero si usted se√±or o se√±ora estudiante llega a retrasarse un solo dia con la cuota, de la puerta no va a pasar, tienes un examen muy importante? No importa, de la puerta no pasas!!! Y si de casualidad usted ya pag√≥ pero se le quedo su factura en la casa... DE LA PUERTA NO PASA! Asi el de seguridad ya haya visto tu factura 40 veces esta semana, igual no pasas, hasta que abra caja a las 8:30 para buscarte en sistema a ver si es verdad que tu pagaste, ah? Como? Tienes clases a las 7:30? Nos sabe a mierda. Les explicare las siglas de IUTA \"Instituto Universitario de Tecnolog√≠a de Administraci√≥n\" tecnologia de administraci√≥n... Y no tienen ningun sistema autom√°tizado para comprobar si estas vigente... Bueno, de paso el semstre pasado estaban obligando a sacarte carnet de estudiante, que se supone que era la solucion a este problema, pero no sirve de nada y solo te sacaron 10$ mas del bolsillo al pedo.\n\nAdemas, si no estas vigente en la cuota te van a tratar mal, pero mal mal, te van a ver feo, te van a hablar como si fueras un ladron que quiere ver clases gratis, en general el trato cuando estas vigente a comparaci√≥n de cuando no has pagado es bastante diferente.\n\nOtra cosa, si usted es mujer y desea ir al IUTA mas le vale vestirse como evangelica, porque si usted lleva un jean roto no la dejaran pasar, si usted lleva una blusa un poco corta, pero enserio, solo un poquito, no estoy hablando de que se te vea el obligo, no, con que se vea una rallita de piel (no exagero, lo he visto) no te dejar√°n pasar, si usted lleva una camisa que muestre mucho su hombro no la dejaran pasar. \n\nAnteriormente usted podia disponer del laboratorio de informatica si necesitaba investigar algo, o hacer algun trabajo, actualmente si quiere usar el laboratorio debe esperar que haya algun profesor en el mismo, ya que corrieron al encargado del laboratorio hace como un a√±o para ahorrase ese sueldo, el resultado? Maquinas da√±adas, llenas de virus y el estudiante ya no puede disponer de este cuando quiera.\n\n\n\nIUTA \"Excelencia Academica\"\n\nHablemos un poco del lema, esta instituci√≥n de hecho premia a la excelencia academica, si usted saca buenas notas te dan cada semestre un reconocimiento por tener el promedio alto... Ellos te dan ese papel mas sin embargo no colaboran en nada para que usted siga teniendo excelencia academica, al contrario, solo le dificultan mas al estudiante el aprender.  Pero saben que? No hay dinero para pagarles a los profesores, o para mejorar la calidad de las instalaciones, pero si hay dinero para pagar fotografos y hacer los shows esos que montan el Instagram para dar la imagen de universidad que se preocupa por el estudiante.\n\nHay varios profesores que honestamente no estan capacitados para dan las materias que dan, no te saben responder a tus dudas, no saben de las materias que estan hablando, nada.\n\n\nPasa muchas veces que la gente se queja de las actitudes de esta universidad comentandoles en sus publicaciones en Instagram, y esta universidad lejos de ver las criticas e intentar mejorar lo que hacen es bloquear comentarios y a las cuentas que comentan.\n\n\n\nA esta universidad no le importa brindar calidad de educaci√≥n, no les interesa la excelencia academica esa de la que tanto se jactan, no, ellos solo quieren tu dinero, no les importa si el servicio que te dan a cambio es malo, el IUTA es todo lo que esta mal con las universidades de Venezuela, como dijo Simon Bolivar  ‚ÄúLas naciones marchan hacia el t√©rmino de su grandeza con el mismo paso con que camina la educaci√≥n‚Äù si no contamos con profesionales capacitados, si la nueva generaci√≥n de profesionales solo seran un monton de mediocres que b√°sicamente pagaron por un titulo (y no es culpa de ellos) entonces no se que futuro le depara a nuestro pais. En fin, si no quieren botar su dinero, entonces no se inscriba en el IUTA"

However, the problem is that they're controlled by light switches and keep getting turned off.\n\nMy guess here is that our guests are trying to follow instructions and make sure the lights are turned off before going to sleep, leaving, etc. I decided to buy some \"switch locks\", but unfortunately, the switch locks appear to be more of a way to avoid accidentally turning it off. They can still be turned off by just squeezing your finger in from the side of the lock switch and turning it on/off.\n\nI've got Lutron smart switches all over my primary home, but the problem with the cabin is that I won't be notified when they're turned off; I'd have to keep checking.\n\nFor those of you who have outdoor security that's controlled by a light switch inside, how do you deal with this?

That time it was around two grams and the same thing pretty much happened. That time I was doing dishes and made it to the couch thankfully. I do not have a history of fainting or passing out, but it has happened the last two times I ate shrooms, both times the same strain albino penis envy. So I believe that tonight will be the last time I trip, hard to let something go that at first helped me mentally and spiritually, now doing more harm than good."

        "text": "Eurostar 9023 took a weird route this afternoon\n\nHad a weird on on the Eurostar this afternoon, and was wondering if anyone could shed light on how this was even possible, as I had assumed the E320 Eurostars were effectively ‚Äúlocked‚Äù to the Eurostar network.\n\nWe were meant to depart Gare Du Nord for St Pancras at 11:12. We were delayed around 30 mins, when the train manager announced due to an ill defined technical issue at Lille Europe, we would be leaving the LGV Nord before Lille, and taking the classic lines onwards towards Calais.\n\nThe train duly left the LGV at Arras, and embarked on a VERY slow tour of post industrial Northern France - literally crawling along at heritage railway speeds. We stopped for around half an hour in Lens, then trundled on to Calais through (I think?) Saint Omer. Very surreal experience going over level crossings in small French towns (which I‚Äôll likely never see again) on a Eurostar. Obviously the buffet sold out of sandwiches. We eventually got up to maybe 100 Kmh as we got closer to Calais. We pulled over in a siding beside the Shuttle terminal, let a freight train past us into the tunnel(!!!) then finally got moving into the tunnel over four hours after leaving paris!\n\nThe train manager said she‚Äôd hadn‚Äôt seen this sort of diversion in ten years working for Eurostar.\n\nI was wondering if you fine people know (a) how is it possible for the E320 to operate on ‚Äònormal‚Äô tracks and signalling systems (my best guess is loco hauled from Lens - Calais?) (b) is this as rare as it seemed (google shed no light on it) and (c) how might the decision be made to even try this rather than wait out the delay or cancel/re accommodate people!\n\nSorry if there is a super simple answer to this, I‚Äôm quite an amateur enthusiast! \n\nSafe to say I was the only person on the entire train to enjoy the experience. There was something absurdly funny about trundling through post industrial France past slag heaps and pit heads before shooting up HS1 to London on an E320,almost the reverse of the good old days at Waterloo!"

I just purchased the LifeStraw gravity filter and after looking more into this product, a lot of people have said that it is VERY slow. I began to doubt this product but the other ones I‚Äôve been looking at, MSR for instance, also have reviews that they are slow. Is it a common thing for gravity filters to be slow?

        "text": "Hello fellow debaters.\n\nI stumbled upon a very interesting Youtube conversation between Bart Ehrman and Alex O'Connor. Ehrman presents an argument that Jesus never claimed to be God, based on a chronological analysis of the sources of information about Jesus (i.e. the bible). Here are 5 key points of the discussion that I thought summerize Ehrman's points:\n\n**Sources of Information:**\n\n* The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are the earliest sources and show significant similarities, suggesting some level of copying. Scholars believe Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source and an additional source called \"Q\" for Jesus' sayings and teachings.\n* Ehrman emphasizes that in all these early sources (Matthew, Mark, Luke, Q, and other special sources), **Jesus never calls himself God.**\n* The Gospel of John, written much later, is where Jesus begins to claim divinity.\n\n**Implausibility of Omission:**\n\n* Ehrman argues it is implausible that all the early sources would neglect to mention Jesus calling himself God if **he indeed made such claims**. **He reasons that this significant aspect would not be overlooked by multiple authors.**\n\n**Claims of Divinity:**\n\n* In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes several \"I am\" statements, such as \"Before Abraham was, I am,\" which Ehrman acknowledges as strong claims to divinity. However, Ehrman suggests these statements likely reflect the theological views of the later community rather than the historical Jesus.\n* In the Synoptic Gospels, when Jesus performs miracles and forgives sins, his enemies accuse him of blasphemy. Ehrman explains this as a misunderstanding or misinterpretation by his opponents rather than a direct claim of divinity by Jesus. He clarifies that Jesus' use of titles like \"Messiah\" and \"Son of Man\" did not equate to claiming to be God, as these terms were understood differently in the Jewish context of the time.\n\n**Crucifixion:**\n\n* Ehrman notes that Jesus was crucified for claiming to be the King of the Jews, a political claim, rather than for claiming divinity. He also points out that if Jesus had openly claimed to be God, he likely would have been executed much earlier due to the severe blasphemy laws.\n\nIn summary, I believe Ehrman confirmed what we Muslims believe in, which is that Jesus neither said he was God nor was he God. I can divulge in much more details on the Islamic view of Jesus but I believe Ahmed Dedat did that better than any Muslim to this day. Ahmed Dedat argued decades ago (also available on Youtube under title: \"Ahmed Dedat: Is Jesus God?\", that Jesus never claimed to be God, and if he was indeed God, then as a God, he would have said it explicitly just like what God/YHWH/Allah said to Moses when he spoke to him on Mount Sinai.  \n\nAs reference to what Ehrman and Dedat's were arguing about, in the Quran in page 127, it is mentioned that God will ask Jesus in the next life whether he told people that he, Jesus, and his mother were Gods as follows:\n\n**Quran (5:116):**\n\n***( And Àπon Judgment DayÀ∫ God will say, ‚ÄúO Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides God?‚Äù He will answer, ‚ÄúGlory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ÀπhiddenÀ∫ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ÀπaloneÀ∫ are the Knower of all unseen. I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: ‚ÄúWorship Allah‚Äîmy Lord and your Lord!‚Äù And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me,*** ***You were the Witness over them‚Äîand You are a Witness over all things. If You punish them, they belong to You after all.******^(1)***¬†***But if You forgive them, You are surely the Almighty, All-Wise.‚Äù )***"

Allows for the planting of two plants at once, in half the space.\n3. Tough Skin - Fruits from seeds that you planted will never explode unless you throw them. Throwing them amplifies their effects by 4 times.\n4. Irrigation - Floods automatically fertilize plants, and fill their fresh water supply for the first 45 seconds of contact. Ballast water is now considered fresh.\n5. My Baby! - When one of your plants is flooded, repair the hull in that room 50% faster.\n6. Dirty Money - You can sell all fruits for twice as much.\n\nTier 2\n1. Root Rage - Uprooting plants that you planted applies a Combat Stimulant to you for 15 seconds. Increase this duration by 0.5 second for every 1% the plant has grown\n2. Peashooter - Having a plant nearby grants a 15% damage bonus on turrets\n3. Plentiful - Gain 75% extra exp for every fruit harvested from a plant you planted in one round. Crewmembers gain an extra 15%.\n4. Juiced - When a fruit bursts in a flooded room, it applies its effects to the water. The effects are doubled for mutated fruits.\n5. Floral Expert - Piloting through Sonar Flora or Ballast Flora increases the pilot's helm skill by 30, the engine's speed by 30%, and the ballast pump speed by 30%.\n6. Potassium Power - Gain a banana each time you survive a mission. Increase the effects of bananas by 300%. Banana peels stun for 10 times as long, and the stun no longer applies to crew members, as long as you were the one to throw it.\n\nBranch 1: Thalamist\n1. Unlocks the Ballast Flora Pacifier recipe (2 steel, 1 FPGA circuit, 2 plastic), which can be placed on any large ballast pump to lure Ballast Flora into it and stop it from affecting the electronics, or harming any friendly players. It will attempt to harm enemies. Only one Ballast Flora Pacifier can be placed in the sub at one time.\n\n2a. Unlocks the plastic bottle recipe (1 plastic), which can be used to harvest sulfuric acid from the Ballast Flora. Increases acid damage by 300% when you throw a sulfuric acid bottle. Sulfuric acid can be loaded into the sprayer, doing 2x the structural damage of a flamethrower.\n\n2b. Unlocks the remote ballast manipulator recipe (1 FPGA circuit, 1 plastic) which can be used to open and close doors and seal all leaks in a single room for as long as another room isn't selected. Only works in rooms that the Ballast Flora has propagated to.\n\n3a. Pest Services - Ballast Flora acid damage increased by 50%. Ballast Flora will attempt to fumigate rooms holding intruders with acid, holding the doors shut unless a crew member attempts to open it. This deals no damage to crew members.\n\n3b. Build-A-Ballast - Creates a Cell Spawn Organ in the associated ballast tank, which releases friendly Leucocytes. These can be grabbed and used as a storage case, or can be commanded to temporarily do an action (repairing the hull, manning a gun, repairing a device).\n\n4. Unlocks the Fleshgun Pacifier recipe (3 titanium-aluminum alloy, 3 FPGA circuits, 3 plastic), which can be placed on a turret hard point. Doing so spawns a Fleshgun there, which can be fired using the associated turret controller. The Fleshgun fires its own ammo source, requiring no power from the super capacitors. When fired, it will act as a harpoon, with any associated skills applying to it. When it strikes a target, either creature or structural, it will release Terminal Cells, further damaging the target.\n\nBranch 2: Biologist\n1. GMOs - Allows for the splicing of seeds with some genetic material or other seeds. Doing so provides the plant with bonuses, or causes both fruits to grow from one plant.\n\nHusk - Calyx eggs can be used as fertilizer, increasing its growth rate by 100%.\n\nCrawler - Water enters any room with a plant in it 20% slower.\n\nTiger Thresher - Generates oxygen in the room, and reduces pressure of water.\n\nHammerhead Matriarch - Increases fruiting speed by 20%\n\n2a.

Pressure Mitigation - As long as there is a living plant in a room, water pressure will never hurt a crew mate.\nUnlock recipe: Plant Symbiosis Device\nThe Plant Symbiosis Device can be used in the gene slot to gain 100% Vigor, 100% Hyperactivity, a 25% health bonus, and a 75% stun resistance while near living plants. Additionally, the plant grows and buds 3 times as fast while near it.\n\nBranch 3: Phycologist\n1. Algae Bloom - As the submarine drives, slime mold begins to grow on it (150 second grow time) This slime mold reduces hull damage by 20% from any creature. Additionally, it allows for running on the hull, if a crew member decides to do so (ragdoll to end the effect). Any other creatures who touch the slime mold get stuck unless they can generate enough force to break free. If the hull is ever breached, the slime mold breaks and must regrow.\n\n2a. Growth Spurt - Slime mold grows twice as fast. Its sticking power is increased by 50%. Its hull protection is increased by 15%.\n\n2b. While walking on slime mold, you deal 50% more firearm damage and 100% more melee damage. When your sub is stuck on slime mold, you gain a 30% turret damage bonus.\n\n3a. Slime Shock - If slime mold is present on discharge coils, their range is increased by 300% and their power by 150%. All connected Slime mold acts as a continuation of the discharge coil. Slime mold's hull protection is increased by 25%.\n\n3b. Lichenous - Crewmembers on slime mold gain a 50% damage resistance and are unable to be stunned or knocked off the slime for any reason. If they are in a diving suit or body armor, the slime mold will grow onto it, increasing its individual resistances by 25%. This effect stops if the wearer takes 80 damage.\n\n4. And Stay Down! - Slime mold sticking power increased by 100%. Creatures who break free are stunned for 6 seconds.\nUnlock recipe: Slime Mold Stabilizer (3 titanium-aluminum alloy, 2 FPGA circuit, 1 fertilizer)\nThe Slime Mold Stabilizer can be installed on a turret hardpoint, and creates a slime mold cannon. It has a separate ammunition, and fires a slime net which restricts and sinks anything that it hits. On larger creatures, it will either restrict them for a lesser duration, or temporarily blind them, which may cause them to miss their target.  (The fired net is wide enough to hit 5 crawlers at once, and takes 30 seconds to break, minus 5 for each creature caught. It has a minimum durability of 10 seconds - 4 creatures damages the net at the same speed of 20. It also makes creatures sink down.)\nUnlock Recipe: Net Gun (2 steel, 1 plastic, 1 fertilizer)\nThe Net Gun is a handheld version of the Slime Mold Cannon. It creates its own ammunition and restricts shot targets to walls, rendering them unable to attack. The nets restrict for 20 seconds, and can blind larger creatures if struck directly in the eyes."

Let me state that again so we‚Äôre all absolutely clear on that point:\n\n#I CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM\n\nI also want to say that I am relieved to hear that Mr. Trump is safe and sound. I‚Äôm glad that the Secret Service reacted quickly once the threat of violence was revealed and swiftly did everything in their power to protect him. I am, however, saddened to hear that one of the attendees of the rally was killed and that others were injured because of the unhinged behavior of one person.\n\nThat being said, I have two thoughts that have dominated my mind ever since I learned of these events and I‚Äôd like to share them with you, especially since these two thoughts lead to a point I want to make that I feel is important for everyone to hear. So I hope you‚Äôll bear with me and indulge me for a moment.\n\n*Thought 1:* While the gunman‚Äôs identity and true motives are not yet confirmed or even entirely clear, his actions were a mistake. Many in the days to come will, and have already started to, take this as an excuse to treat Trump as a kind of political martyr. The attempt on his life will be seen as an attempt to silence a voice that many see as speaking out against the powers that be and his candidacy can only be bolstered by this.\n\n*Thought 2:* Mr. Trump, himself, made a mistake when he was finally pulled from the floor of that stage by defiantly raising his fist and mouthing the word ‚ÄúFight‚Äù. There are many on the right who were already looking for an excuse to attack the people they see as enemies and what Mr. Trump has done is the equivalent of lighting a match and tossing it wantonly towards the powder keg that our country already was. What he did will, undoubtedly, just inspire a new wave of violence motivated towards those on the left who speak against Trump.\n\nThis all leads to my point and, once again, let me perfectly clear on the fact that I condemn political violence of any kind.\n\nMy point is simply this. It is perfectly valid and understandable to disagree with a political ideology, party or even a specific candidate. The very idea of America is that we should be free to debate the issues and discuss both sides. That‚Äôs what enables us to find the common ground necessary for us to move forward as a country. I have made it clear to the people in my life that I disagree with Trump‚Äôs position and his rhetoric as well as many of the key talking points that the MAGA movement is trying to push forward. However, I will never let my disagreement over these issues devolve into violence because history has shown, time and again, that it only leads to more violence.\n\nIf you disagree with a candidate, if you disagree with a political party, if you disagree with any kind of idea put forth by someone running for any kind of government office, there is only one acceptable way to make your point and do something about it.\n\n#VOTE.\n\nGo to the polls in November, cast your ballot and make your voice heard. That is not only our right but it is our responsibility, for ourselves, for our families and for our communities. Vote for the person whose beliefs and ideals most closely align with what you feel is the right direction for yourself and the people you care about. And don‚Äôt just vote for the person your family or friends or coworkers or anyone else tells you to vote for. Learn everything you can about both sides of the debate and make an informed decision about who you think is most fit to lead us forward into the future.\n\nPlease do not give into hatred or fear. Please move forward from these most recent events with a clear and calm mind and, if you want to stop a candidate from being the next leader of the free world, do it the right way. Make your voice heard and vote.\n\nThank you for your time, my fellow Americans. Have a good day and stay safe."

It's probably one of the worst ones I've worked, nearly as bad as Mother's Day. \n\nThe partner in DTO is still new (bless her heart, I love her so much) and soloing, so things are going a little slower than normal. I was at bar 1, and we had a partner at bar 2 and another at cold bar. We also got someone to clock in later in the day and do some CS.\n\nMobiles were non-stop for four hours. Bar 2 partner got overwhelmed and took her headset off, so we couldn't communicate clearly regarding mobiles being picked up in the drive-thru. Several drinks were stolen off our hand-off plane by unsupervised children or entitled assholes who wanted to avoid the wait times, so they had to be remade. \n\nThe lid on my shaker slipped because my hands were soaked from barring non-stop, and I got pelted in the face with an entire Trenta Dragon Drink, making the entire lobby go silent, followed by some teens making fun of me.\n\nSM was there but barely helped; he stood in the lobby for about 30 minutes with an iPad, asking what drink we were on so he could clear out the DPM. \n\nThen came the angry customers when all four to eight drinks in their order weren't half off-- just one. So many people cussed us out today, complaining about prices and the long wait times. When ringing up people up front, I told them it would be at least a 20-30 minute wait before we even got to their sticker. \n\nThe CS partner became overwhelmed by all the backup requests and noise from angry customers, so they and I switched places while they calmed down (bar is their favorite position). \n\nI pleaded with the bar 2 partner to stop pulling stickers and do them as they come out or look at the DPM, but she was in such a state of shock from the rush and rude people that she couldn't process my request. \n\nAt this point, I was leading the shift more than the SM (who was also the Shift on duty because we only have two SSVs, and they both were in overtime already). \n\nI surfed Indeed and applied for jobs during my 10.

It is healing and improving, but I still struggle with a burning sensation that travels upwards when it's aggravated and a constant \"clogged\" ear feeling. I started my first BPC-157 injection into my neck yesterday and will continue this treatment for the rest of the month. I've been advised to continue for three months and, if that doesn't work, to explore PRP with stem cells. I'm also seeing a chiropractor who has helped fix the damage done by the other one on occasion, doing some traction, decompression, and curve correction.\n\nThe local place where I got the peptide recommended also taking collagen and mentioned they have it in powder form. I had some genetic testing done that shows I'm 80% more prone to osteoporosis than the general population, so I'm pretty scared and want to do everything I can to avoid getting that in my neck. For reference, I'm a 36-year-old female and have other health issues I'm battling as well.\n\n### Questions:\n1. **Collagen Recommendations:** What collagen brands are the best? \nShould I get powdered collagen from my peptide provider, or are there better options available?\n2. **Diet and Supplements:** Are there any specific supplements or other peptides I should consider to support bone health and recovery from my neck injury?\n\nAny insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Optionally allow the other players to aide them via their proficiency or spells/abilities that give bonuses to skill checks, however I would shy away from allowing the other players to make attack rolls outside of unarmed strikes to try and brake their focus, perhaps once where the element of surprise is involved.\n\n\n\nOutcome: A more interesting and challenging way to probe the mind of an NPC with higher risk/reward"

Im thinking it would be Mew/Mewtwo. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nOne thing I think I like about Gen 1+2, is it's more of show instead of tell. The player is left to discover where they need to go and do. Even though I liked USUM, I know a lot of players don't because of the ongoing dialog etc. Which oddly, so many hacks do just this. So I wanted to get opinions on this part too.\n\nI also like the idea of incorporating different teams for the rival depending on if you beat him the first few times, like in Yellow. Any suggestions on teams? Since there are three starters, I'm guessing nine teams? I forget how many possible options are in Yellow. Win at Oak lab + route 22, lose at Oak lab + lose at route 22, etc. Obviously it doesn't have to be different Pok√©mon, but maybe just different movesets."

It's a cool CLI tool that we created as part of an internal team hackathon.\n\nEarlier, deploying a model to Triton was very tough. You had to navigate through the documentation for the Python backend, figure out how to get your inputs and outputs right, write a bunch of glue code, create a¬†`config.pbtxt`¬†file with all the correct parameters, and then package everything up. It could easily take a couple of hours.\n\nBut with Triton Co-Pilot, all that hassle is gone. Now, you just write your model logic, run a command, and Triton Co-Pilot does the rest. It automatically generates everything you need, uses AI models to configure inputs and outputs, and handles all the tedious parts. You get your Docker container ready to go in seconds.\n\nCheck out our GitHub repository and see how much easier deploying to Triton can be!

        "text": "Hinduism Today is a quarterly magazine that was established many years ago to advance Hindu Solidarity. (and to combat ethnocentricity that lies within Hinduism itself) Many Hindus, (and yes, here on this forum) feel that their version of Sanatana Dharma is the most important one, or sometimes the only one. With newcomers, this does pose a challenge, as they can erringly think that one person's response is that of the entirety of Hinduism, which is blatantly false.\n\nI'll give an example of this ... the other night I was speaking to a person at the temple I attend regularly, and mentioned that our city has 12 temples. She was quite shocked, and said, \"What? I thought there were only two.\" She's lived in this city some 20 years, and still didn't see the diversity just within this city, let alone the entire planet. It's not that surprising as in the past, the various sects were isolated geographically. But I also don't think it's accurate, or that healthy for some sort of brotherhood. On this very forum, we have a section called 'criticism of other sects'. Personally, I'd like to see another section titled 'admiration of other sects'.\n\nOver some 40 years, Hinduism Today has published 100s of articles, about all things Hindu, and is the only Hindu publication of it's kind, as it doesn't restrict itself to articles about one sect like many other Hindu publications do.\n\nSo here's the main link to it, the latest issue just came out, and the entire body of work, many years of journalism, is free to browse.¬†[/](/)¬†Hopefully somebody will benefit from this."

It‚Äôs been assumed since that he had vEDS. My dad‚Äôs sister on the other hand had it all, you name it and she had it, every symptom on the EDS spectrum, I was never able to have a serious conversation about vEDS with her because she started taking about how she had it worse like it was some kind of twisted competition, she was very ill her whole life and ended up dying from aortic dissection but the abdominal type. \n\nHer eldest daughter (my cousin) died age 27, she caught pneumonia and her organs collapsed. It was very rough for all of us cause she never showed signs of anything either. \n\nAnd now my dad, he seem to have great health and we talked many times about how I got vEDS from his side but he was completely healthy, he was very active and complete normal, he had a few aches here and there nothing weird for his age (he was 60 and his sister 62 when they passed that‚Äôs a lot for vEDS). \n\nHe had a type A aortic dissection, he woke up feeling weird and asked my mom for some water, he thought it might be blood pressure and then he vanished as we were calling an ambulance, he came back and walked down the stairs by himself to the ambulance and left with my mom, the next call was my mom telling me we had to say our goodbyes.\n\nThis was two days ago, two days ago my whole world was turned upside down and I have to tell you, I‚Äôm devastated, I never ever in my life expected this to happen, I thought I would go first or maybe my mom cause she‚Äôd had more health issues throughout her life. \nI wasn‚Äôt prepared for this at all and I don‚Äôt really think everyone ever is but if I had only knew. I‚Äôve never felt so lost and desolated, I‚Äôm so sad and now I‚Äôm also scared because I have a younger sister and what if she has it too without showing symptoms?

        "text": "TL;DR Unless you understand food cost, stop complaining about the prices of BBQ.\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about BBQ prices so I thought I‚Äôd provide some perspective.\n\nYou can get prime brisket at HEB in Texas for about $4.30 per lb right now. Most restaurants are using either prime or upper 2/3 choice from Creekstone, SVF, 44 Farms, etc. At the volume they order at, they‚Äôre getting them for somewhere between $3.50 and $4 per lb. Just for the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say they get them for $3.50 per lb (though the vast majority pay much more). A good BBQ restaurant is going to lose 30% of the raw weight during the trim process. The trim doesn‚Äôt go to waste but it doesn‚Äôt get sold as sliced brisket. That raises the price to $5 per pound. You easily lose another 30-40% in weight during the cooking process (again, for sake of argument, let‚Äôs say 30%). Now we‚Äôre sitting at about $7. Many places allow customers to choose between fatty and lean brisket. Seeing as the **vast** majority choose fatty, that leaves a certain amount of lean that often doesn‚Äôt get eaten. That‚Äôs another 10% that goes to chop for other dishes that cannot be sold as sliced brisket. That‚Äôs brings us to about $8 per pound as our final cost per pound of brisket that can be served. Remember for this next part that I was being incredibly generous with all the figures.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the concept of food cost, it‚Äôs the percentage of the final price of food that covers the actual food. The rest covers labor, rent, utilities, fuel to run the smokers, supporting food items (seasonings, cooking oil, other flavorings, etc), insurance, disposables, serve-ware, and all of the other things on the unbelievably long list of what it costs to keep a restaurant going. Standard food cost for a BBQ restaurant is somewhere between 20-25%. So in our example, they would have to charge between $40 ($8 / .2) and $32 ($8 / .25) to stay within that range. Most places charge less than this in order to stay competitive ($31 on average from what I can tell). This is called a loss leader. They **lose** money on this item. They are able to make it back on other menu items but they are literally making something they can‚Äôt make money off of. There‚Äôs literally 10 other constraints specific to BBQ I can think of that would make you even more grateful that you‚Äôre getting the prices that you are but this post is already too long.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ understanding all of this information, you‚Äôre telling me that you expect to be given a pound of brisket, two sides, bread, pickles, onions, and a drink for $30? And you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs the **RESTAURANT** that‚Äôs being greedy? I fully get that the dollar doesn‚Äôt stretch as far as it used to and BBQ is a luxury that everyone can‚Äôt afford everyday but don‚Äôt for one second think that you‚Äôre a victim of greed. Restaurants are one of the lowest profit margin and highest risk businesses you can have. So the next time you feel like complaining about the price of a tray of BBQ, maybe just make some food at home and keep it to yourself."

We took him to the vet, got him all fixed up, but whilst he was there the vet noticed that he had fallen severely underweight from being ill (he couldn't smell and so he wasn't eating anything). Since then he's been put on some special food to help him gain weight, and we've been advised to mix it with fish so that he enjoys it plenty. For the first few weeks, he was so so excited to eat his food. We mixed it with sardines and he devoured it, it would be gone in seconds. He was back to eating regularly and was gaining weight. But now he's stopped?\n\nHe still eats occasionally, and he's always trying to steal mine or my partners food. But almost every other day he won't eat his food. It's like a routine. One day he'll be perfectly happy to eat his food and then the next day he won't eat it at all. Instead he'll attempt to bury it. He'll scratch and claw and anything around him in an attempt to cover his food. Why?? It's not the sardines (or the tuna as we swap around the 2) as he's happy to eat them on their own. It's not the medical food, we'll feed him from the same tin the next day and he'll eat it just fine. I doubt it's even the combination of the two, as my other cat will inhale Honeys food the second he gets a chance to. We keep it fresh, heat it up so he can definitely smell it (another bit of advice we were given) but sometimes he just prioritises burying it and we cannot think of any possible explanation. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated as I would quite like my cat to be eating every day and not every other day - especially as he's started loosing weight again. Nothing else is wrong with him. He is otherwise a perfectly healthy and happy cat, he just likes to bury his food sometimes."

I'm still only in Los santos. Every time I think I'm going to  \nwake up back in Vice City. When I was home after my first tour,  \nit was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing...  \nI hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.  \nWhen I was here I wanted to be there. When I was there, all I  \ncould think of was getting back into the Vice City.  \nI've been in Los Santos 11 years now. Waiting for a mission, getting  \nsofter. Every day I stay Los Santos I get weaker. \n\n\"I was going to the worst place in the world, and I didn't even know  \nit yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles in a Kosatka and plugged into the world of El Rubio It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of El Rubios memory, any more than being back in Los Santos  \nwas an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling  \nmy own. And if his story is really a confession, then so is mine.\n\nEl Rubio (on tape)  \n\" We must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig, cow after  \ncow, village after village, army after army. And they call me an  \nassasin. What do you call it when the assasins accuse  \nthe assasin ? They lie.. they lie and we have to be merciful  \nfor those who lie. Those nabobs. I hate them. How I hate them...\"\n\nMy mission is to proceed through the ocean and meet Pavel in a Russian Navy  \nKosatka. Pick up El Rubios path. follow it, learn what you can along the way. When you find  \nEl Rubio's infiltrate his team by whatever means available and  \nterminate the Rubio's command.\"\n\nHow many people had I already killed? There was those 120,000 that I know  \nabout for sure. Close enough to blow their last breath in my  \nface. But this time it was an American and former officer. That wasn't  \nsupposed to make any difference to me, but it did. Shit...charging a  \nman with murder in Los Santos was like handing out speeding  \ntickets in the Indy 500. I took the mission. What the hell else  \nwas I gonna do? But I didn't know what I'd do when I found him.\"\n\nAgent Kilgore had a pretty good day for himself. They chopped  \nt-bones and beer and turned the Cayo into a beach party.  \nThe more they tried to make it just like home, the more they  \nmade everybody miss it. He wasn't a bad officer, I guess. He loved his boys and they  \nfelt safe with him. He was one of those guys that had that  \nweird light around him. You just knew he wasn't gonna get  \nso much as a scratch here.\"\n\nMeeting El Rubio I thought that the minute I looked at him, I'd know what  \nto do, but it didn't happen. I was in there with him for days, not under  \nguard - I was free - but he knew I wasn't going anywhere. He knew  \nmore about what I was going to do than I did. If Mini Madrazo back in  \nLos santos could see what I saw, would he still want me to kill him?  \nMore than ever probably. And what would his people back home want if  \nthey ever learned just how far from them he'd really gone? He broke  \nfrom them and then he broke from himself. I'd never seen a man so  \nbroken up and ripped apart\n\nThey were going to make me a hero for this. Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier, standing up, not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even Cayo Perico wanted him dead, and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.¬†\n\nEl Rubio (dictates to tape)  \n\"They train young men to drop fire on people. But Rockstar won't allow them to write fuck on their yachts because it's obscene! \"\n\nI killed El Rubio with a machete. \n\n\"the horror\"\n\n\"the horror\"\n\nBack in Los Santos, They gave me over a million dollars. We threw limes over a rail. I watched some asshole fly past me in a jetbike. I still dream of the day I will get back to Vice City."

The limited edition posters sell out very quickly, get there early if you want one (max two per person, 400 available). Small amounts may also be available inside the venue once doors open. A limited number of posters are typically available directly from the artist in the days after the show, look for more info on the artist's social media pages. The limited edition shirts do not sell out as quickly as the posters and will also be available inside the venue once doors open.\n\nLast minute face value tickets tend to be posted on the day of the show (or the days leading up to the show). Pay close attention to Ticketmaster. Once the doors open, you can typically grab cheap resale tickets on Ticketmaster and Stubhub (sometimes as low as $40).\n\n## Fancy Tickets\n\n[VIP Lounge, Early Entry, Premium Ticket Information](/tour/one-more-time-tour)\n\n**You will receive an email with an itinerary closer to your tour date.

In RoN you can tell your element to get into different formations allowing you to raid building easier, in Breakpoint you have no such luxury, either going in first and sending yourself to your death or sending your team in first where they all go in different directions and do their own thing until you die again because you can't even order them to cover you.\n\nTDLR I don't like AI teammates they take you out of the experience and you can't command them enough to form actual tactical plans."

One time she brought home a guy she met at a coffee shop once prior. At some point she brought home a guy that she barely knew, met maybe once or twice prior and while they were hanging out he exposed himself to her and she started tearing up and had to tell him leave. I have had MANY conversations with her (at least 3 or 4 separate conversations about this exact problem) about how uncomfortable it makes me that she keeps bringing home men she barely knows and she tells me that she understands my concern but she wants to have her \"shordy\" over and I tell her \"why can't you go to their house?\" There's always some excuse. In the end I thought she came to see eye-to-eye with me but today I knocked on her door and when I opened it there was some random dude she's mentioned to me one time that she said she met at a show. She's hung with this guy maybe twice at music shows, and I sent her a long paragraph telling her how i don't appreciate her continuously crossing my boundaries and disregarding my feelings. Things got really heated. I used the guy that exposed himself as a prime example as to why I don't like when she has random men over and she said \"I don't appreciate you using me being damn near sexually assaulted against me\"???? I told her it's unfair for her to put me in danger and that frankly I think she's being unsafe and putting herself in danger as well and she said \"I'm an adult I can gauge situations for myself\". The whole conversation was very unproductive and basically resulted in us not talking to each other anymore and hiding in our rooms. Am I in the wrong here????"

        "text": "Reddit has a website-wide social credit system (labelled \"Contributor Quality Score\"). This basically ranks every single user into 5 categories, from highest to lowest, to weed out spammers or 'less-positive Redditors'. This takes into account various factors (e.g. 'network signals') and can change based on the \"behaviour\" of a user. A \"reputation filter\" can be used to auto-remove comments from \"low quality\" users.\n\nReddit also uses fingerprinting to identify users unknowingly (especially if you use Tor). This uses data given to by the device to the website for it to function properly (e.g. fonts installed, screen size) to build up a profile of a user and identify them, even if they use a VPN.\n\nThere's little freedom of speech on Reddit. I'm not taking about mod censorship, but censorship by admins themselves. Conservative and centrist viewpoints are actively censored and users banned. Many conservative subreddits or male-centred subreddits are banned. Even the entire Russia subreddit is quarantined. The admins are particularly extreme on certain topics, like a certain group I cannot even type on this post. Even moderate left-wing opinions are censored on the issue, users report getting banned simply for using the word \"biological women\".\n\nIt's made 10x worse by Reddit's shadowbanning accounts. Instead of being honest, Reddit will typically secretly ban accounts. Users can continue to post, but all their posts will be visible to only them, giving them the illusion that their account is still up and wasting their time. One user spent over a year shadowbanned while still making comments.\n\nReddit is an echo chamber. Due to systematic removal of non-liberal and non-neoliberal viewpoints, Reddit has become much of an echo chamber. The front page is almost always filled with pictures of Trump or Elon Musk in a negative light, and an entirely one-sided presentation of the election and hatred for undecided voters for \"helping Trump win\", without any alternate viewpoints. Plenty of times, they come from non-political subreddits that ideally should not be biased, like photography subreddits. This builds up a false narrative detached from reality and nuance, and is probably why there's an \"unhinged Redditor\" stereotype.\n\nReddit doesn't care about it's users. The API protests which did nothing showed that. Reddit also sells your content to train AI. You often can't browse Reddit on a VPN anymore, comments are now \"data\" for a corporation.\n\nReddit extensively uses bots. Many decisions like flagging content, and banning accounts are done by \"Reddit's automated systems\". Reddit does not usually respond to appeals, and has closed its support email addresses. Comments are collapsed based on Reddit's \"automated systems\", and \"harassment filters\" which uses Language Learning to remove comments, and plenty of normal comments get caught in such filters.\n\nOn top of this (which admins are all responsible for) you have the power hungry mods. Subreddits you haven't ever been to banning you because you participated in another subreddit. Even hobby subreddits being \"left wing only\". Mods banning you and removing your comments because you disagree with them. Don't even try if you have a new account, there's only a select a few places you can post because of karma requirements."

We trimmed back the bamboo on our property (hauling two tonnes to the dump) up to the easement between our home and our neighbors on the next street over. However, every spring, we would be out there at least every other day knocking down dozens of new shoots just to keep it at bay in the egress. So, about 4 weeks ago, we had a landscaper come and cut all the bamboo in the easement (which measures about 10 feet wide and 60 feet long) down to ground level - we can‚Äôt dig it up because we don‚Äôt own the property so this felt like the best solution (pic 1: makeshift brick border showing edge of our property line). In the weeks since, bamboo roots have kind of serpentined up out of the ground in the easement at which point we have cut or pulled them up as much as we can, and we have had little tufts of leaves that we have weed whacked down but no new shoots. However, this week we have gotten probably a dozen shoots spring up - not in the easement but as far as 20 feet into our yard where we haven‚Äôt seen shoots before (pics 2 and 3). We are pulling the ribosomes as we can, but it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôve pissed off this bamboo! \n\nMy question for you experts is ‚Äî should we just keep on weed whacking/mowing/pulling ribosomes as we can through the summer/early fall to keep it at bay, or should we go ahead and do the roundup or vinegar/salt/dish soap combo, then lay down thick tarp and wood chip the easement and try to stem it that way? My hope for next year is to plant privacy bushes along our property line, but I want the bamboo under control before I make that investment! Helllllpppp!"

The main difference between FSRS-4.5 and FSRS-5 is that FSRS-5 takes same-day reviews into account, plus the formula for difficulty for the first review has been tweaked, but that's not super important.\n\nFSRS-5 is not available as part of Anki yet, only as a standalone copy-paste-code-in-the-custom-scheduling-field thingy. Release: [/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/releases/tag/v5.0.0](/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/releases/tag/v5.0.0) People who have experience with anything Github-related are welcome. Tutorial for those who haven't used copy-paste-code FSRS before: [/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial2.md](/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial2.md) Basically, you need to optimize parameters using Google Colab ([fsrs4anki\\_optimizer.ipynb](/github/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/v5.0.0/fsrs4anki_optimizer.ipynb)) and then copy-paste them into the custom scheduling code ([fsrs4anki\\_scheduler.js](/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/v5.0.0/fsrs4anki_scheduler.js)), which itself goes into the custom scheduling field. If you find any issues, report them here: [/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/issues](/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/issues)\n\nAll of this is, of course, much less convenient than using the built-in FSRS, so I'm not saying that everyone is welcome to participate in testing, only people who are at least somewhat tech-savvy. Right now, it's not clear when FSRS-5 will be integrated into Anki natively, hopefully before the end of the year."

I've been told by former professors to \"steer clear of that path,\" but I'm honeslty not sure how true that is. Currently I work as a remote therapist (I know, why give up a WFH job) well - every clinicians salary will be cut 20% effective August, with opportunity for eating potential (not guaranteed by any means) So even though a WFH job affords me the lifestyle I want to live, making 20,000 less than what I presently make will not.

It was fine at first but lately seeing all my friends and family having stable lives and success gives me anxiety. I'm not envious but I'm just feeling that I am missing out on a lot. I'm 23 and I hope it's normal to feel this way. My sleep schedule is ruined for so many years, I used to get to bed 10 at night but after being so addicted, I go to bed at 2-3am bc of endless scrolling. I felt super weak and having headaches often.\n\nSo I deleted my social media apps last night (not accounts bc I have too many precious memories there) except for Tiktok and Reddit bc these two are the source of entertainment I could rely on. Currently feeling unsure if I should do this but I'm trying to improve my lifestyle and I should discipline myself I wanted to get better.\n\nI'm hoping someone could give me some advice so I could feel that I'm not lonely on this one."

        "text": "I'm very curious how Americans doctors approach treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in women...\n\nI'm a GP in an European country with an universal health care system. Furagin (furazidine) is actually an OTC drug and because of its extremely low cost, availability, few side effects and efficiency is my 1st drug for uncomplicated UTI in women. Other drugs, including fosfomycin, are prescription only.\n\nConsider this telephone consultation I recently had with a patient...\n\nPatient: I'm going abroad for vacation. I get frequent UTIs and I'M SURE I'm going to have one there. I always do. Could you prescribe me an antibiotic?\n\nMe: Sorry, no. You can get an OTC furagin if you'd like to have something just in case.\n\nPatient: Furagin never works for me! Can't you get me something else?\n\nMe: No. I don't prescribe antibiotics \"just in case\" for symptomless patients.\n\nPatient: But what If I get an infection??\n\nMe: Go see a doctor.\n\nPatient: Ohhh, right... I'm baffled by your attitude. I don't understand why it's such a problem, I've never had any issues getting an UTI antibiotic for me or my kids.. and you're telling me to go see a doctor!!\n\nSo this situation made me wonder whether perhaps I'm being too overzealous... perhaps I could've prescribed her fosfomycin, it's a single-dose drug, risk of harm is relatively low... on the other hand I absolutely hate when patients try to treat or diagnose themselves because they absolutely suck at it. In 100% of cases when a patient comes to me after failing to treat their UTI with furagin it's because they can't figure out proper dose regimen... and from dozens of urine cultures I've done so far I have yet to see a single case of furagin resistance in the area I practice. Also perhaps if this patient stopped trying to treat herself perhaps we'd have to chance to look for the reason why she gets recurrent UTIs in the first place.\n\nAm I the asshole or what?"

        "text": "Hello. \n\nOriginally, I have to admit, this actually was just log number 14, but as I wrote this section and stated \"If I do logs, there's no way to do long versions without them being contrived or as a large chapter\". Needless to say that I stopped posting and started writing again. Sorry if quality seems to be dropping over the last few chapters, life has been getting in the way, and I just cannot seem to get words out on paper as well as I could. Either way, here's the next couple of logs from Frost.\n\n[Previous](/r/HFY/comments/1dr3eos/the_long_wars_newcomers_departure/)/[Wiki](/r/HFY/wiki/series/the_long_wars_newcomers/)/[Discord!](/invite/F2Y9C27pCd)/Next\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n  \n\\**(Log #014)*\\*\n\nWell, oh-so-dear weary traveler‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not dead.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm still not sure how, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs going to last, but I am alive.I‚Äôm writing this (Yes, I‚Äôm actually ‚Äòfingers on touchscreen‚Äô typing this) in a damn closet somewhere in this ship because I don‚Äôt want anybody reading over my shoulder. Chippy‚Äôs inside the AKDU though, so she gets to read every word.\n\n\\[I do! But I‚Äôm not connected to the network, so I can‚Äôt send this out to anyone anyway! -SNAI ‚ÄòChippy‚Äô\\]\n\nI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll add something in, but I can‚Äôt tell until after I save this and read it again, mainly because she‚Äôll most likely add it in after the time of writing.¬†\n\nSpeaking of time, it is currently‚Ä¶ 17:53, May 25th, 2132. That‚Äôs using UNITF standard time, of course. That also means that I‚Äôm only about four weeks from being thirty.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm almost an old man now, so now I think my main objective should be simply surviving until the point at which I‚Äôm properly an old man.¬†\n\nShip life is going to be boring. We‚Äôre about‚Ä¶ three weeks out from our objective, and the most I should have to deal with is training. I‚Äôll keep you apprised if anything happens in between, but I should be good. Now, I want to point two things out:\n\nTravel time, and that one-week (6 days, actually) survival period for me to actually make it to thirty.\n\nTo address travel time first, it makes *very* little sense; If we were to take an exo-territorial path at standard Ma‚Äôprisian cruising velocity, we‚Äôre looking at a 7 to 8 week transit time, 5 weeks if we were to go as the crow flies through Kxa territory. So this means that we‚Äôre likely traveling at much-higher-than-cruising velocities on a straight-line run. I‚Äôm definitely on an undocumented (by Humans) Ma‚Äôprisian ship right now.¬†\n\nThe second thing I want to address is that week I have to ‚Äòsurvive‚Äô once we make it there; Sa‚Äôkil all but confirmed that her command structure is attempting to kill me with this last mission; possibly to make sure that I can leak nothing or some shit, who knows.¬†\n\nWhether that‚Äôs the actual case or she‚Äôs just fucking with me, I still need to make it off the coming shithole. I have two things I need to do back on Earth:\n\nGet a burger from Sammy‚Äôs, and deliver this rogue AI I have to a‚Ä¶ trusted friend.\n\nIn other news, I heard from Kinsey not long ago, the parents gave me a call, and Nelson Adams, director of JPL, called me. I‚Äôm apparently important now.\n\nThat‚Äôs a problem for me to deal with later, though. As of now, I‚Äôm going to go work on my CEVA. She‚Äôs a little run down.\n\nCorporal Frost, clocking out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\**(Log #015)*\\*\n\nHello, it‚Äôs me again.¬†\n\nI continue to survive, sure. But thrive? No.\n\nToday, *\\[May 27th -SNAI ‚ÄòChippy‚Äô\\]*, I was told ‚Äúhey, suit up in that CEVA, we‚Äôre doing training.‚Äù\n\nNow, I thought this would have meant that we were doing some shooting practice or shit out in EVA or something. (PSVA, as the Ma‚Äôpris call it.)Well, that wasn‚Äôt the case. Instead, I was supposed to go to one of their bays for hand-to-hand combat. To be fair to the Ma‚Äôpris, they *do* have powered PSVA suits. And they‚Äôre actually quite heavy for usual Ma‚Äôprisian gear weights. But they are **not** CEVA suits.\n\nCav told me this was happening because the new shipmaster wanted to test me. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be the real reason though. She‚Äôs apparently some new commander who rose through the ranks quickly, got herself an amazing field record, and then got herself a command spot on an incredibly prestigious mission. This is where I come into play.\n\nI‚Äôm some fuckin‚Äô Human who just showed up on her ship and stole her wind; All eyes are on me.¬†\n\nAs Cav put it:¬†\n\n‚Äú*Officially, she‚Äôs doing this because she doesn‚Äôt trust your skills to be on par with a Ma‚Äôpris‚Äôs. Unofficially, I believe it‚Äôs a matter of pride. She‚Äôs a new, up-and-coming commander with an impressive track record. Everybody on board and at home should be talking about her leading this important mission behind enemy lines. Instead, they‚Äôre focused on the lone Human Marine Corporal that‚Äôs carved a scar from one end of the stars to the other, leaves a trail of blood with every step he takes, and decided to come back from the dead.*‚Äù\n\nThat woman‚Äôs got a way with words. It‚Äôs not a good way, but it‚Äôs certainly a way.\n\nTo give a summary on how it went: I‚Äôm not making any new friends.\n\nWhy? Well, I‚Äôm going to give you an idea of the two sets of armor that were being pitted against each other:\n\nThe Ma‚Äôprisian powered PSVA suit is a four-hundred pound, plasma-hydraulic assisted, armored suit meant for combat on moons and space stations. It was built with the express purpose of simply enhancing a soldier‚Äôs movement and awareness in zero-pressure, hostile, and Hazardous environments. It has a plasma blade in the left arm, ballistic armor that is comparable to XSAPI rating, energy dissipation systems that blow ours right the fuck out of the water, and plasma shields. It has a decent strength enhancement factor, but it‚Äôs really only enough to help them move and maneuver in the suit.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the Raytheon/General Dynamics Exo-Atmospheric Powered Combat Vehicle, Version Three, System Enhancement Package Version One. Also known as the M113 CEVA 7.\n\nIt weighs 535 pounds *without* an operator or armor plating on it, has 20mm UHMWPE followed by 5mm of spall lining weaved into the outer fabric (Making the two suits have the same ballistic armor rating ***before*** the 560 lbs of armor plating is added onto the suit), and was **expressly** engineered to give Human operators a leg up in close-range, hand-to-hand-distance combat against aliens.\n\nNow, which aliens were they thinking of? God only knows, because we‚Äôve found out that our planet‚Äôs environment *already* gives us that leg up in terms of strength.¬†\n\nAnyways, I‚Äôm not going to give you a play-by-play of the fights, because if you know basic physics, you can already guess how the fights went before you even factor in operator skill.¬†\n\nI won‚Äôt lie, I actually did attempt to throw the first few fights. I did this to hopefully make the commander feel better. Unfortunately, because these were non-lethal fights, the Ma‚Äôpris couldn‚Äôt use the *one* melee weapon at their suit‚Äôs disposal that would have made the fight be in their favor. I hope that nobody was tapped into the suit‚Äôs facecam (aside from Chippy), because I would have looked bored with some of those fights. I know *everybody* describes those suits as ‚Äòwalking tanks‚Äô, but I always thought it was a bit of Human pride doing that. In terms of infantry, (which they are counted as, in the UNITF), they are tanks. You would need anti-armor weapons to engage them.¬†\n\nAnyways, I have made *no* friends here. This ship seems either infatuated with me, or infuriated with me. No in-between.\n\nCorporal Frost, signing off."

I'm concerned about getting stressed with the former but bored or demotivated with the latter. I've been in both labs already and they are both good atmospheres. Obviously, there is a difference in salary (higher in Amsterdam) but also in years (less in Paris). And after the PhD I would like to transition to biotech or public health, so maybe it would be easier with my better level of French but I wonder if there are more or less opportunities in Paris? Overall, I want to do good research but also a balanced personal life.\n\nBasically, how should I prioritise different aspects in the decision-making process? Or do people that have worked in both/any country as expats have any insights e.g., on job prospects? I keep going around in circles and am hoping someone has a fresh perspective..."

This is my SPR \"build\" it's all  sig aside from the barrel (18\" noveske spr), timney impact, hogue overmold, topped with an athlon helos 4-20x50 in a vortex cantilever mount. The central group was a warm up with 68gr hornady frontier. The single group on the second target is a 20rd group of black hills 69gr otm. Following this say, the barrel has ~200 rounds and I'm gonna run a couple patches through it. I'm thinking this is sufficient for 6-700ish yard shooting once or twice a year. Hopefully, I get better. I haven't been able to shoot as much as I like compared to last year. Longest range I've had access to since last year is 50yds and it's been more pistol than anything. These were shoot off a plastic rest. Stabilized by me."

        "text": "Thought I'd ask ChatGPT to write an article for JW.org since WT are probably writing one now üòÇ I was surprised how easily it put everything together and just how accurately it depicts the style of real JW.org articles. \n\n**Are Assassination Attempts a Sign of the Last Days?**\n\nIn recent times, news of assassination attempts on world leaders and influential figures has become alarmingly frequent. Such events raise important questions for thoughtful individuals: Are these violent acts mere isolated incidents, or do they indicate something more profound about the times we live in? For Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, these occurrences are seen as a significant sign that we are living in the last days, as foretold in the Bible.\n\n### The Increase in Violence and Lawlessness\n\nThe Bible provides a detailed description of the conditions that will prevail in the last days. At 2 Timothy 3:1-5, we read, ‚ÄúBut know this, that in the last days perilous times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.‚Äù\n\nThis vivid description fits our modern world well. The increase in assassination attempts is a stark manifestation of the ‚Äúfierce‚Äù and ‚Äúbetraying‚Äù attitudes that characterize these perilous times. Such violent acts underscore the deep-seated instability and lawlessness that pervade human society.\n\n### Jesus‚Äô Prophecy About the Last Days\n\nJesus Christ himself prophesied about the last days in what is often referred to as the Olivet Discourse. In Matthew 24:12, he said, ‚ÄúBecause of the increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number will grow cold.‚Äù The increase in assassination attempts and other acts of extreme violence is a clear indication that lawlessness is on the rise and that the love for fellow humans is diminishing.\n\nMoreover, Jesus warned that the last days would be marked by ‚Äúnation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom‚Äù (Matthew 24:7). Political turmoil and the frequent targeting of political figures for assassination are evidence of the intense conflicts and divisions Jesus foretold.\n\n### The Need for a New Government\n\nThe Bible‚Äôs depiction of the last days is not meant to instill fear but to provide hope and direction. The increasing violence and lawlessness highlight the urgent need for a new kind of government‚Äîone that can bring about true peace and security. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses believe that this government is Jehovah‚Äôs Kingdom, a heavenly government established by God and ruled by Christ Jesus.\n\nThis Kingdom is not a mere human endeavor but a divine solution to mankind‚Äôs problems. Daniel 2:44 foretells, ‚ÄúIn the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.‚Äù\n\n### A Kingdom That Brings True Peace\n\nJehovah‚Äôs Kingdom will achieve what no human government has been able to‚Äîlasting peace and security. Isaiah 9:6, 7 speaks of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, as the ‚ÄúPrince of Peace‚Äù and assures us that ‚Äúto the abundance of his princely rule and to peace, there will be no end.‚Äù Under this divine rulership, violence, including assassination attempts, will be a thing of the past. Revelation 21:4 promises that in God‚Äôs new world, ‚Äúdeath will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.‚Äù\n\n### Preparing for the End\n\nAs we observe the increasing instability and violence in the world, including assassination attempts, it becomes evident that we are living in the last days. These events should motivate us to take action. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses actively share the message of God‚Äôs Kingdom, encouraging people to learn about Jehovah‚Äôs purpose for humanity and how they can align their lives with His will.\n\nJesus advised his followers to ‚Äúkeep on the watch‚Äù and ‚Äúprove yourselves ready‚Äù (Matthew 24:42, 44). Now is the time to study the Bible, draw close to Jehovah, and support His Kingdom. Doing so ensures that we can face the future with confidence, knowing that soon Jehovah‚Äôs Kingdom will bring an end to all suffering and establish a world where righteousness dwells."

But, when surrounded by so many distractions, pursuing the passion with the focus is difficult. On many occasions, caught between these distractions, you can't go with the flow to get important things done. Your days, weeks, and months pass, living in an uncertain terrain, feeling victimised.\n\nMy journey has involved embracing a morning walk, meditation, reflection techniques, and reading books to strengthen my conviction and draw inspiration. These help me maintain my focus.\n\nI have learned that you must discover your strengths and focus on developing them rather than pondering your weaknesses. For example, if I am good at creating products/services, I should strengthen my thinking, innovation, and brainstorming skills.¬†\n\nThe other thing that helps me keep moving is actively seeking opportunities to explore my aptitude in different/adjacent fields that complement my strengths. It‚Äôs like a side project that offers an opportunity to strengthen your core.\n\nAnother key realisation has been the importance of not spreading myself too thin. Instead of trying to excel in every area, I‚Äôve learned to rely on others who can complement my strengths. We all have unique abilities, and by focusing on our strengths, we can surpass the capabilities of generalists.\n\nWith these, the only things left for me to focus on are managing my thoughts, applying my strengths with full focus to get things done, and pursuing stability that will lead to the path and outcome that I desire.\n\n\n\nGod Krishna meant to say to Arjuna that this is about the mind and achieving results with focus."

        "text": "I've dealt with frequent episodes of waking during sleep paralysis since I was a child. Usually, my immediate urge is to try and get out of that state and start moving. However, recently I've found myself exploring the state more. Usually I just try to impose some hallucination onto my surroundings, which is enough to transition me into being fully awake, but it can be fun for a few seconds.\n\nAbout a week ago I found myself in sleep paralysis again, and had the random thought \"what if I try to meditate\", so there I went and tried. Instead of focusing on myself being stuck in this state of paralysis. I looked at the objects around me and noticed how there was no center that is \"seeing\", there is only what is seen. I immediately feel into a state of meditation I normally can't achieve during wakefulness, my heart began pounding and I burst awake with all the physiological signs of panic, then calmed myself.\n\nThis morning I found myself in a state of sleep paralysis again and decided to give it another go. My motion was limited to opening my eyelids and closing them, and I couldn't even move my eyes beyond micro adjustments, and, ofcourse, I could control my breath. I paid close attention to the sensation of breathing, and noticed how there was no observer in addition to what was being observed. Immediately I fell into a state of noticing I can't normally achieve during wakefulness, and a pulsating wave of euphoria quickly washed over my body. Thoughts continued to arise, but behind my thoughts were layers of consecutive abstractions (impressions building upon each other) that finally arrived at a complete thought. My thoughts began to blend with all other sensations, to the point where the experience of thinking could be mistaken for any other sensation. With every passing second, the euphoria grew stronger until my heart began racing again and I jolted up out of my dreamy paralysis in a state of panic. I then calmed myself, again. I would say this entire experience lasted no more than 10 seconds, it all happened very quickly.\n\nThat's it so far, it's been interesting to experiment with, and I'm not sure I would really call it \"mediation\". However, results have certainly been novel."

        "text": "In the heart of Pakistan, a family‚Äôs brave decision to convert to Christianity marked the beginning of an arduous journey fraught with peril. This family's story is one of immense courage, facing severe persecution for their newfound faith. Their ordeal began with their conversion, a decision that was met with immediate backlash from their community and local authorities.\n\nUpon their conversion, the family faced relentless threats, ranging from verbal abuse to physical violence. The mother, once a respected member of the community, was stripped of his social standing and ostracized. She recounted how neighbors her once considered friends turned hostile, making daily life a test of endurance. The children faced bullying at school and expelled, their once bright futures now clouded by fear and uncertainty.\n\nThe threats quickly escalated to legal troubles. Accusations of apostasy, a serious crime in Pakistan, were leveled against them. The family was subjected to invasive investigations and frequent harassment from law enforcement, rendering them virtual prisoners in their own home. Despite the looming danger, they remained steadfast in their faith, finding solace in their belief and the support from a small, Ex-muslims Christian community.\n\nThe mother‚Äôs poignant anecdotes reveal the depth of their struggle. She spoke of the constant fear that gripped her every time her children stepped out, worried they might not return. The family‚Äôs financial situation deteriorated as the mother get divorced due to her faith. They sought help through various channels, including reaching out to[¬†Grace United Church](/)¬†and seeking donations from those willing to support persecuted Christians. The search for a donation center near them often felt like a lifeline amidst the chaos.\n\nDespite the hardships, the family's story is not only one of despair but also of unwavering hope. They continue to reach out for support, utilizing platforms like Charity Navigator to find reputable organizations willing to provide aid. Their courage in the face of adversity serves as a poignant reminder of the severe realities faced by many persecuted Christians worldwide. Through donations and the goodwill of others, they cling to the hope of one day living without fear, free to practice their faith openly and without repercussion.\n\n**In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,**\n\n**2 Timothy 3:12**"

I thought I had been given a plain croissant today, but no ‚Äî they‚Äôve changed the design. It is now a rounded croissant, with the ‚Äúcheese baked in‚Äù to it. That‚Äôs what I was told. \n\nI‚Äôm not even sure if I tasted the cheese at all. The dough was heavier and tinted orange, but I got none of the cheese flavour. In my opinion, the best part about the cheese croissant before was the crunchy cheese on top! Now it‚Äôs just a plain looking, probably cheaper to make, piece of dense pastry and it‚Äôs _awful_.\n\nAnyone else experience this ‚Äúnew menu item‚Äù??"

Well not every game has a Leona or Kench available.\n\nSo what do you do? When you have a Jhin running around one shotting half the team. Build armor, they build armor penn. Build health, they have execute that before you can even get to Jhin he is gone. If he has hands and lands his W then you are rooted.\n\nThis is just for the adc, god forbid you lost the rng lottery and they have a soroka or sona helping them or any type of frontline.\n\nADC burst damage is so high, Nothing I build seems to matter against them. Every game unless you get a crazy tank comp with Zac is an auto loss if the enemy has more adcs than you.\n\nThe only ADC that is fine to deal with Kaisa because she will go AP and miss 99/100 of her Ws but she is usually the one you get on your team while the enemy gets Jinx/Jinx/Zeri or Ezreal."

First of all Regular is a tad too thin for my purposes (display on the web) and secondly medium is too fat. I would love to have a weight exactly in between. Also I kinda hate the fact that it just gets wider, the more bold the letters get.   \n  \nSo I wondered if someone ever attempted a \"modern\" & \"improved\" version like e.g. there is [American Grotesk](/collections/american-grotesk/) by Klim based on Franklin Gothic or [Items](/items) by Schick Toikka, an updated version of Times New Roman? Please if possible no Adobe or Google fonts, I usually like to buy licenses from type foundries directly. The smaller, the better."

        "text": "tl;dr‚ÄîI find all kinds of ways of filling more time before I break my fast (when I have the time), to extend the time I‚Äôm in fat-burning or super-fat-burning mode. Do you? And, if yes, why?\n\nI‚Äôm quite new to this subreddit and intermittent fasting, but I‚Äôm willing to guess there are probably different ‚Äúcamps‚Äú into which most people tend to fall, in general. Like some people are mostly doing it for aesthetic reasons and hope to improve their self-esteem by losing a lot of weight, for example. \n\nI would probably fall into two or three ‚Äúcamps‚Äùrather than just one. I am almost 50, I have a 4.5yo child, and I‚Äôm simply not capable of accepting the ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù and not being able to actively engage in a variety of physical activities with an active kiddo‚Äîactivities that I also want to enjoy on my own‚Äîto the degree that I‚Äôve been capable of in the past. \n\nI‚Äôm also a hobbyist distance runner and rely on doing a lot of running to manage my mental health. But various factors over the past few years made it almost impossible for me to get back to the running shape that I had been in prior to the arrival of my kiddo, mostly because I couldn‚Äôt shed the 15-20 extra lbs I‚Äôd acquired. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm AuDHD (autistic and ADHD), and that affects the way I think about, approach and just do many things. For example, many autistic people don‚Äôt feel hunger and/or thirst. We can become hyper-focussed on an activity, and we‚Äôll forget to eat or drink for hours, and it doesn‚Äôt bother us. So we often create routines into which eating and drinking are built. \n\nIt‚Äôs the last ‚Äúcamp‚Äú that I belong to that makes me wonder how many other people out there delay breaking their fast. I do it simply because it‚Äôs not that hard to do at all. I suspect people in other ‚Äúcamps‚Äù might be feeling they‚Äôre going to die of hunger before it‚Äôs time to break their fast, and then they just dive into feasting as soon as their fasting goal has been reached.\n\nI‚Äôm actually doing it right now. I just finished running 6.5K and walking another 1.5K, and now I‚Äôm spending time on this post when already past 21 hours of fasting. üòÜ\n\nSo‚Ä¶who else out there delays breaking their fast, and why do you do it?"

I've been looking all over reddit at everyone's predictions, and i truly do think they are very accurate. if che and colin do leave i will literally be so sad. Weekend update is one of my favorite parts of the show.\n\nI'm so excited to see more of marcello, as i think we can all agree he has really been incredible and stolen the show during S49.  As a latina, i hope if they choose to hire more cast members for this season, they hire a Latina woman.\n\nSadly, i do think that if anyone is to get ejected from the show, it will likely be molly or longfellow. I agree with most people, that i don't find either of them very funny. While they have had their moments, i don't feel that either of them have really stuck out to me.\n\nI really do hope that Ego, Marcello, Heidi, and Punkie never decide to leave the cast. They really are my favorites. Although, I highly doubt Marcello will be leaving anytime soon as he is likely to be promoted as a full-time cast member this scene and has really become one of the best cast members on the show."

It was like when the coach shows why she teaches and you still need to study. \n\nShe knows exactly how to use her body in general but also to the best effect to the music. Her twerking and also her hair whips are always on point musical wise. \n\nBut she also understands silence and stillness which gives the much bigger effect. \nBest to see in the beginning of the battle against Jorgeous. Presence needs to be seen to work. Can only work if the audience is not distracted by unnecessary movements. Roxxy shows exactly that. \n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean low energy but energy channelled to where it‚Äôs needed. \nWhen the song is high energy she does that, too. But with intend. \n\nTL:DR. I‚Äôm impressed and will take her art into my dancing."
